Django

1. create virtual environment, activate it, then install Django inside it
	python -m venv djangoPy3Env
	call djangoPy3Env\Scripts\activate 
	pip install Django

2. Create your project in some directories, then go to the project folder, as follows:
	django-admin startproject your_project_name_here
	cd your_project directory

3. Run the server using the following command then open it in the browser: 
	python manage.py runserver
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/

4. For every app we want to add to our project, we'll do the following:
	your_project_name_here> python manage.py startapp your_app_name_here

5. for file settings.py, add the App to the  INSTALLED_APPS dictionary as follows:
	INSTALLED_APPS  = [       'your_app_name_here', 

6. in the project  urls.py, add URL of your app
	from django.urls import path, include
	urlpatterns = [ 	    path('', include('your_app_name_here.urls')),

7. in the App, create file called urls.py, add the URL
	from django.urls import path     
	from . import views
	urlpatterns = [ path('', views.index),   ]

then in our app's views.py file, put a function called index 
	from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse
	def index(request):
    		return HttpResponse("this is the equivalent of @app.route('/')!")

8. python manage.py runserver
